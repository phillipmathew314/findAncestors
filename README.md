# findAncestors
This program takes in a graph as input with two of its nodes, and returns a boolean indicating whether the two nodes have any common ancestors. I used an adjacency matrix with only ancestors indicated (children not marked as 1) and a vector to keep track of which ancestors have been visited already to solve this problem.
